h1. Windows, Linux, OS/X

If you are using a linux or OS/X you probably don't have to do much to make things work here.  
If you are using windows, you'll need to install cygwin.  Please goto: http://www.cygwin.com/
Cygwin, gives you the power of Linux on a windows box.  Just go through the default install.

When you are installing, specifically add: @OpenSSH@ to the items to install.  If you need git specifically search for and add it too.  Several options will come up...just add them all.

h1(#sshAutoLogin). Setup automatic login to ssh server

h2(#keypair). Generate your public/private key pair

If you already have a private key DON'T create a new one.  The following command will let you know if you already have one.

bc. [root@del ~]# ssh-keygen

h2. Copy to server

Copy your public key to the server.    

Command Format: 

bc. ssh-copy-id [username]@[host]

Example:

bc. ssh-copy-id ftravers@spicevan.com

Test this works by logging into the server, and ensure it DOESN'T ask you for a password now.

bc. [root@del ~]# ssh ftravers@spicevan.com

bc.. 
[oracle@linux1 u02]$ ssh-copy-id oracle@myhelpstage.sg.oracle.com
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: ERROR: No identities found
[oracle@linux1 u02]$ ssh-agent $SHELL
[oracle@linux1 u02]$ ssh-add
Identity added: /home/oracle/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/oracle/.ssh/id_rsa)
[oracle@linux1 u02]$ ssh-copy-id oracle@myhelpstage.sg.oracle.com

h1. have sshd run on another port

Add line like: 
Port 10122
to:
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
[root@proddb ssh]# service sshd reload

update firewall:
To add a new port, run the following and
	[root@ucm3 ~]# /usr/bin/system-config-securitylevel-tui
Choose Customize,  add a line like: 
8888:tcp
to the other ports section, OK, OK.
	[root@ucm3 ~]# service iptables restart
	
==> Automatically log into servers:
	> If you haven't already generated your key pair with: ssh-keygen -t rsa, do so.
	> grab the file: id_rsa.pub and get it into the server you want to auto ssh into, put it in
	the root directory /root.
	> ssh into the host then do: 
cd /root/.ssh; cat ../id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys; chmod 600 authorized_keys; rm -f ../id_rsa.pub
