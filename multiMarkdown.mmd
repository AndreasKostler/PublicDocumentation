# Markdown

[Ref](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

## Headers

Headers are specified by the number of `#` (hash) symbols you use at
the beginning of a line.

    # This is header1
    ## This is header2, etc...

## Links

To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately
after the link textâ€™s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses,
put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optional
title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:

    This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.

    [This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.

## Block Code

To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the
block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input:

    This will be regular text.
        But this line will be block code!

## Inline Code

To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike a
pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal
paragraph. For example:

           Use the `printf()` function.

## Convert textile -> markdown

Easiest to just convert already converted HTML into Markdown.  The
following converts a file called emacs.html into emacs.mmd
(multi-markdown)

    pandoc -f html -t markdown emacs.html > emacs.mmd

## Lists

### Unordered 

Can use *, +, or - for unordered lists.

### Ordered

Any number followed by a period.

    1.
    3.
    3.

Still produces, 1, 2, 3.  (Actual number used is unimportant)
