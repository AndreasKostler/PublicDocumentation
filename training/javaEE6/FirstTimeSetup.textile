h1. Introduction

This document will explain how to setup your system for developing modern dynamic web sites.

h1. Required Software

h2. Eclipse

Eclipse will be your primary development environment.  Download the Java EE Edition from @http://www.eclipse.org@.  For full setup instructions go "here":../machineSetup/eclipse.html

h2. Code Repository

You will be sharing code with other people in a Subversion code repository.  You need to install the SubClipse add-on to eclipse to enable this functionality.  Download eclipse from @http://tigris.org@.  For full setup instructions go "here":../machineSetup/eclipse.html#subclipse

h2. Maven: Dependency Management

For your coding you will be depending on third party libraries.  Managing these can be a head-ache without an automated system.  Maven is the system we will use for this.  Download and install maven from @http://www.codehaus.org@.  See "this page":/maven.html for detailed documentation.

* You will tell eclipse once where your maven repository is with the following command: (ensure that Eclipse is not running)

bc. mvn -Declipse.workspace=/home/ft/workspaces/wksp1/ eclipse:add-maven-repo

I have found on windows this is easiest to do by cd'ing to your workspace folder then doing:

bc. mvn -Declipse.workspace=. eclipse:add-maven-repo

* Install the m2eclipse maven pluggin.

h2. Cygwin

If you are a windows user you'll need to install @cygwin@ as well, otherwise if you are a linux or mac user you can skip this step.  *** put in some instructions on how to install cygwin here. ***

h1. Setup Project

* In eclipse right click in the project explorer and choose: @Dynamic Web Project@.  Name it.  We'll call ours @tailor@ for demonstration purposes.

* press 'Next' and make Java Source Directory = @/src/main/java@

* press 'Next' and make Web Source Directory = @/src/main/webapp@

* click 'Finish'

* Right-click the @tailor@ project and choose: m2 Maven > Enable Dependency Management

* Supply the required info: group id, artifact id, packaging = war.

* Add folders:
** @/src/test/java@
** @/src/main/resources@
** @/src/test/resources@

* Add a new run configuration to copy the required libraries to WEB-INF/lib

bc. Run > Run Configurations...

* Base directory: @${workspace_loc:/t5}@

* Goals: @dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib@

* Open the _Servers_ view and select @Add and Remove...@, shuttle your new @tailor@ project from the left pane to the right pane.

h2. Add required tag libraries

See: "Required Tag Libraries":TagLibraries.html for the required tag libraries to add to your pom.xml.

h1. Conclusion

That's it your finished and now ready to begin developing your website and learning new technologies.  Suggested next step:
