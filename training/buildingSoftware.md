1. First create the project you want with
[Maven](/maven.html#createProject)

2. Make sure that you allow the project to be added to the [GIT
repository](/training/git.html#addingProjects)

2. Next setup your pom.xml so the project will be reasonable.  The
best advice is to look at an existing pom.xml to figure out what to do.

2.1 Setup [distribution management](/maven.html#distributionManagement).

3. Get [git](/training/git.html#initialize) setup for your project.

3. Code and [release](/maven.html#release) a version of your artifact.
