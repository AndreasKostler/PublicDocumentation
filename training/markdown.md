To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately
after the link textâ€™s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses,
put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optional
title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:

      This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.

      [This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.
