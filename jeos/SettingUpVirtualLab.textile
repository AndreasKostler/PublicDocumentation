h1. Overview

This document will describe in broad strokes the steps you need to go through to establish an Oracle Virtual Machine Lab.  It assumes that you have 1 dedicated 'server'.  This should be any old desktop with as much RAM as possible, 4GB is considered a minimum.

h1. Steps

h2. Install OVMS

OVMS(Oracle Virtual Machine Server).  You can download the iso from "eDelivery":http://edelivery.oracle.com/linux

bc. 
Select a Product Pack: Oracle VM
Platform: x86 32 bit
Oracle VM 2.2.1 Media Pack 	2.2.1.0.0 	B58990-04 	OCT-22-2010 	

This is your base system now.  Hopefully you setup a static IP address.  Lets just say it is: @192.168.8.2@.  Lets call the machine @vmsrv.mydomain.com@.

Once you have OVMS laid down.  You need to download the OVMTB(Oracle Virtual Machine Template Builder).  This is also located on "eDelivery":http://edelivery.oracle.com/linux.

bc. 
Select a Product Pack: Oracle VM
Platform: x86 32 bit
Oracle VM Templates for Oracle VM Manager 2.1.5 Media Pack for x86 (32 bit)

h2. Template Builder Template

You will download the template build template.  
This is a virtual machine that you will untar on your OVMS.  
Then you will launch it.  Steps:

* Untar to folder: @/OVS/running_pool/OVM_EL5U2_X86_64_TMPLBUILDER_PVM/@

bc. 
[root@vmsrv OVM_EL5U2_X86_64_TMPLBUILDER_PVM]# ls
data.img  README  System.img  vm.cfg
[root@vmsrv OVM_EL5U2_X86_64_TMPLBUILDER_PVM]# cat vm.cfg
bootloader = '/usr/bin/pygrub'
disk = ['file:/OVS/running_pool/OVM_EL5U2_X86_64_TMPLBUILDER_PVM/System.img,xvda,w',
        'file:/OVS/running_pool/OVM_EL5U2_X86_64_TMPLBUILDER_PVM/data.img,xvdb,w']
memory = '1024'
name = 'OVM_EL5U2_X86_64_TMPLBUILDER_PVM'
vcpus = 1
on_crash = 'restart'
on_reboot = 'restart'
vfb = ['type=vnc,vncunused=1,vnclisten=0.0.0.0']
vif = ['type=netfront']
[root@vmsrv OVM_EL5U2_X86_64_TMPLBUILDER_PVM]#

Notice the changes I've made from the default vm.cfg.  The location of the file images will need updating.  Launch the vm with:

bc. 
[root@vmsrv OVM_EL5U2_X86_64_TMPLBUILDER_PVM]# xm create vm.cfg

h3. Configure Template Builder Template

Follow all the steps in the following documentation section:

* "Setup a static IP and ...":/jeos/oel_detail_setup.html#staticIp

h3. TB Web Interface

Now that the network is properly setup, we can SSH into the machine and 
abandon our VNC client from now on in.  Lets assume that the machine name 
is: @tb@ and that it's IP Address is: @192.168.8.3@.

Rebooting this machine we can then open a browser on your laptop and put the following URL in:

bc. http://tb/ovmtb

Select the @register@ link, choosing @oracle@ to be the username and @welcome1@ to 
be the password.

h3. Getting the JeOS Template

Again from: "eDelivery":http://edelivery.oracle.com/linux we can grab the JeOS templates we want.

bc. 
Select a Product Pack: Oracle Linux
Platform: x86 32 bit
JeOS Oracle Linux 5 Update 5 base image x86 (32 Bit) 	V21114-01 	135M

and

bc. 
Select a Product Pack: Oracle Linux
Platform: x86 32 bit
JeOS Base x86 and x86_64

You'll eventually end up with the following files after you've downloaded the above and unzipped them:

bc. 
[root@vl-vmsrv2 jeos]# ls
ovm-el5u5-xvm-jeos-1.1.0-1.el5.i386.rpm  ovm-template-config-1.1.0-1.el5.noarch.rpm
ovm-modify-jeos-1.1.0-2.el5.noarch.rpm

h4. Easy Disk Access

To make your life easier, we'll NFS export a folder on the OVMS and mount it on the OVM Template Builder VM.  In OVMS's @/etc/exports@ add:

bc. /OVS/downloads tb.mydomain.com (rw,sync,all_squash,anonuid=500,anongid=500)

In the @/etc/fstab@ of the @tb@ machine add:

h3. Install JeOS Images

bc. 
[root@linux1 jeos]# rpm -ivh ovm-modify-jeos-1.1.0-2.el5.noarch.rpm 
Preparing...                ########################################### [100%]
